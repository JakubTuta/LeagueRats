## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your machine
- Riot Games API Key (get one from [Riot Developer Portal](https://developer.riotgames.com/))
- Firebase project setup

### Firebase Setup

1. Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Authentication and Firestore Database
3. Generate your Firebase configuration and service account credentials

## Running app with docker

#### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JakubTuta/LeagueRats.git

cd LeagueRats
```

#### 2. Set up environment variables

Create `.env` files in the main directory, `/backend`, and `/scheduler` with the following content:

```bash
# Firebase Project Config
API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id

# Firebase Service Account
TYPE=service_account
PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
PRIVATE_KEY_ID=your_private_key_id
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
CLIENT_EMAIL=your_service_account_email
CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
AUTH_URI=https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth
TOKEN_URI=https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token
AUTH_PROVIDER_X509_CERT_URL=https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs
CLIENT_X509_CERT_URL=your_client_cert_url
UNIVERSE_DOMAIN=googleapis.com

# Riot Games API - Only in /backend and /scheduler
RIOT_API_KEY=your_riot_api_key
```

#### 3. Starting app

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

FastAPI server runs on `http://localhost:8000`  
Frontend web app runs on `http://localhost:3000`

## Running each module separately

### 1. Starting FastAPI server

```bash
cd backend
```

Create virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Run virtual environment

```bash
# on Windows
venv/Scripts/activate

# on MacOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the modules:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure your `.env` file is properly configured in the `/backend` directory.

Now you can run the server

```bash
# with FastAPI CLI
fastapi run main.py

# or with uvicorn
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

FastAPI server is running on `http://localhost:8000`

### 2. Starting Frontend app

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
# replace npm with any package manager
npm install
```

```bash
# replace npm with any package manager
npm run dev
```

Frontend app is running on `http://localhost:3000`

### 3. Starting Scheduler (if applicable)

```bash
cd scheduler
```

Create virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv/Scripts/activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure your `.env` file is properly configured in the `/scheduler` directory.

Run the scheduler:

```bash
# with FastAPI CLI
fastapi run main.py

# or with uvicorn
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
